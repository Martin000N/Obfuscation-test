# Obfuscation-test
***SUP.***
This is just a tiny 3d renderer i made quickly to try coding in C. It was my first project. I had no guidance on how 3d rendering worked, I just wanted to figure some basics out by myself. If you have any questions about it, feel free to contact me.
If you want to run it yourself, do it on windows and compile with gcc ob.c (no additional flags needed). The "walls" are calculated with out-of-bounds array access, so it can crash any time or it can find garbage values. Also in the deobfuscated version the variables are not in english but its ok i think :3

***DO MAKE SURE YOUR OS IS WINDOWS OR IT WILL NOT WORK.***

***NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE.***

To move use **wasd**, to look around **rt**.
