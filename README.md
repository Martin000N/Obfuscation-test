# Obfuscation-test
***SUP.***
This is just a tiny 3d renderer i made quickly to test something out. If you have any questions about it, feel free to contact me.
If you want to run it yourself, do it on windows and compile with gcc ob.c 

***(!!! DO MAKE SURE YOUR OS IS WINDOWS OR IT WILL NOT WORK!!!).***

To move use **wasd**, to look around **rt**.
